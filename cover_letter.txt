Dear Editors of the Stata Journal,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "autolabel: Automating
variable and value labeling in Stata" for consideration for publication in
The Stata Journal.

This paper introduces autolabel, a Stata command that automates variable
and value labeling from centralized, multilingual metadata repositories. The
command operates at institutional scale, enabling organizations to
programmatically compile metadata from their documentation systems into
standardized CSV repositories. This transforms metadata from per-dataset
documentation into shared infrastructure for reproducible research.

The paper makes three contributions:

1. Technical contribution: A deferred execution pattern using temporary
   do-files inside preserved sessions to safely separate dataset inspection
   from transformation, enabling inspection-based command generation.

2. Architectural contribution: A domain-agnostic CSV-based metadata schema
   that operates at institutional scale. Organizations can programmatically
   export metadata from their systems into standardized repositories,
   treating metadata as infrastructure rather than per-project documentation.

3. Practical contribution: Demonstration that scalability enables
   methodological benefits (reproducibility, auditability, automation) to
   extend from individual projects to organizational and cross-national
   research infrastructure. Multilingual metadata enables instant language
   switching without modifying datasets.

The autolabel command has been available in production use at Statistics
Sweden since October 2024 and has been adopted by research groups at several
major Swedish universities.

The submission includes the complete manuscript, source code, reproducible
examples, and synthetic datasets. All examples can be reproduced offline
using the included files.

We confirm that this manuscript is not currently under review by another
journal and that we will not submit it elsewhere before receiving a decision
from The Stata Journal. All authors have approved this submission.

We believe this tool will be of interest to Stata users working with
administrative and registry data across disciplines, particularly those
requiring metadata infrastructure at institutional or cross-national scale.

Thank you for considering our submission.

Sincerely,
